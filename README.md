# Overview

This repository of R scripts pertain to custom codes used for imaging mass cytometry analysis of primary and metastatic breast cancers in the manuscript by Grasset et al. "Mapping the breast tumor microenvironment: proximity analysis reveals spatial relationships between macrophage subtypes and metastasis-initiating cancer cells".

## Input data

All raw MCD data files are available on 10.5281/zenodo.10688895
Also available on Zenodo repository is the file "backup_output.rds", which contains fully annotated data frame that can be loaded onto the R script to generate the figures published in the manuscript.
In `Input_files`, there are metadata, panel, and merge (annotation) files, as well as two processed tables that can be loaded to generate heatmaps from Figure 5D.

## R scripts

Scripts stored in `Rscripts` need to be run in the numerical order.

## Output data

`Output_files` contains all figures generated from the scripts in this repository.
Figures larger than 25MBs were omitted.
